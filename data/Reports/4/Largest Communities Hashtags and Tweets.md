99.782% : Think about how harshly #BlackLivesMatter &amp; #AbolishICE activists were debased, called rioters, &amp; treated as a threat to society.

Now watch &amp; examine how this MAGA-armed rushing of a state legislature is treated.

This is for those who still think racial privilege is a fantasy. https://t.co/nEufuBRFKo

35.349% : Oh my God ... not again ... this is horrific ... #SeanReed #BlackLivesMatter  
17.209% : You want to know where #BlackLivesMatter intersects with the COVID-19 pandemic? It starts w/ health disparities, winds through low-wage, hourly work, takes a right turn at refusal to accept scientific reality &amp; unfortunately in this case, it ends with a horror story. #RIPBigDuper https://t.co/GSwdreXX25  
14.419% : Shoutout to ppl who criticized #Kaepernick, scoffed at #BLM, retorted w/false arguments tweeting #AllLivesMatter and/or #BlueLivesMatter. And THEN wanted to ally when the monster #Trump that YOU helped create turned on you. For the record,üëáüèΩTHIS is our reality that you denied. ‚úåüèΩ  
09.302% : If you still don't understand why young people had to create a hashtag called #BlackLivesMatter -- something that should be obvious -- just peep this headline and take in the utter coldness of it: "Sean Reed Shooting: Detective Joked About 'Closed Casket'" https://t.co/2D18OiqUs5  
08.372% : For so many of these #BlackLivesMatter cases that I covered in 2014-2015, the D.A. in question had been around, with barely any political opposition, for years if not decades. The D.A.'s seat tends to be one of the safest political offices, since mainly the Tough On Crimers care.  
06.977% : Protests during political campaigns are fine. I saw #BlackLivesMatter protest Sanders at #Netroots in 2015, conservatives protesters during the GA governor's race in 18' and all sorts of local events. What happened at the Biden event last night however, was a problem  
04.186% : A thread about being led by the nose:
When #BlackLivesMatter was at a peak, we started to see an increase in pushback about people killing police. It happened right before the 2016 election. Every single story that came out, there was an attempt to place the blame on BLM.
