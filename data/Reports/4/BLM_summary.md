| 3198 | Think about how harshly #BlackLivesMatter &amp; #AbolishICE activists were debased, called rioters, &amp; treated as a threat to society.Now watch &amp; examine how this MAGA-armed rushing of a state legislature is treated.This is for those who still think racial privilege is a fantasy. https://t.co/nEufuBRFKo |

| 57 | NEW: @aliciagarza, co-founder of the #BlackLivesMatter movement and anti-racist champion, has endorsed @ewarren. This. Is. Huge. https://t.co/oTOWY6SGGS |
| 55 | Africans in #China continue to be beaten senselessly.#BlackLivesMatter everywhere.https://t.co/v7UDEPSpBU |
| 53 | True that @HeatherGautney! This is a prime example of how #BlackLivesMatter only matter when it is politically expedient to a specific political agenda. The primary in Wisconsin &amp; the 26 other remaining states should be postponed to save lives. Where is the outrage? #COVID2019 |
| 51 | Have U ever heard any word from #BLM in condemning CCP for racism against Black comunity in China?Where are those intersectional feminsts that glorify #ShariaLaw in this matter.#ChineseVirus &amp;Political Correctness are both dangerous &amp; let me be clear the latter is more dangerous. |
