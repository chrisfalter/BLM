| 2882 | Susan Rosenberg is VP of the fundraising arm of #BLM. She was charged for her role in the 1983 bombing of the United States Capitol Building and other targets. Convicted for explosives possession in 1985, she was sentenced to 58 years in prison. She was sprung by Bill Clinton. https://t.co/fHZgM5YUeN |
| 2756 | I haven‚Äôt endured an anti-gay attack like this in probably 10 years. #BlackLivesMatter activists physically assault me &amp; Mike Harlow on our way into our hotel, calling us faggots &amp; threatening us. The one girl comes back &amp; knocks my friend‚Äôs phone out of her hand.#BLM= violence https://t.co/Cmhc4g57tU |
| 2676 | So a white guy shoots and kills a black cop - father of three - and there isn‚Äôt a word from #BlackLivesMatter, the @NBA, @NFL, @NHL, and @MLB. But if a cop kills a black career criminal or sex offender, they want to burn the city down. Think about that for a minute! https://t.co/ZHGdhnnBkk |
| 2292 | This is a HUGE update on the #BlackLivesMatter donation scandal. It turns out I was right, and Politifact lied‚Äî Black Lives Matter is NOT a recognized charity. More information coming soon. Stay tuned. @BLEXIT and @JudicialWatch are looking into the #BLM scam financing. |
| 2038 | His parents started a business in their garage forty years ago. Democrat-supported #BLM and  #Antifa terrorists burned it to the ground. For no reason.   https://t.co/L5YTlx0wVd |
| 1947 | ‚ÄúHow did #BlackLivesMatter become about LGBTQ when blacks really really aren‚Äôt about that?...we‚Äôre conservative. We don‚Äôt support abortion. We‚Äôre not about feminism... I‚ÄôM NOT VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN‚Äù#BLEXIT #Trump2020 https://t.co/3EXn3KI2bD |
| 1751 | After a 1 year-old was shot &amp; killed, blacks in NYC are calling for a crime unit that was disbanded as a result of #blm protests, to be reinstated.Shootings for the week are up 277% since last year.Meanwhile, @BilldeBlasio is playing arts &amp; crafts in front of Trump Tower. https://t.co/AjnpwJK5z2 |
| 1738 | Rochester, N.Y.: #BLM rioters swarm a restaurant and knock over the dining tables. https://t.co/lxa0b5hHeh |
| 1527 | The same people who chanted #BlackLivesMatter are now questioning a black woman‚Äôs medical credentials because she got her medical degree from Nigeria. Where did they get theirs? |
| 1490 | Watch how ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù #BLM protestors coordinate, surround and then attack me-simply because I am filming their police-escorted parade in the middle of Georgetown. I was physically assaulted and one of them snatched my phone. An owner of a nearby restaurant came fo my aid. https://t.co/W6wPooJvKU |
| 1456 | Citizens with AR-15‚Äôs stopped #BLM rioters from destroying another automobile business. Is there anyone with an IQ over 60 who doesn‚Äôt grasp the necessity of the #SecondAmendment by now? https://t.co/zus7fReqwG |
| 1404 | I am asking law and order Democrats to leave the party. #Blacklivesmatter and #Socialists have hijacked the party. It is no longer the party of #JFK.  @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow @FoxNews |
| 1225 | .@tedwheeler Portland is your responsibility, not President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs! You have allowed #BLM and #Antifa militants to control your city for more than 100 days! You‚Äôve done nothing about it! You‚Äôve refused help from the federal government! That killing is your fault! |
| 1136 | The godfather of #BLM and his hateful rhetoric are why we are where we are now... https://t.co/LgLK8hZZPM |
| 1123 | Last I checked, Q doesn‚Äôt have supporters out there killing cops but #BLM doesGuess who Twitter decided to ban |
| 1099 | Let‚Äôs be very honest - Fmr President Obama did not help race relations in this country. #BLM started under his watch - #Ferguson riots etc |
| 1049 | I'll say it again: #BlackLivesMatter is a domestic terror organization. https://t.co/N7lolHTTO6 |
| 1046 | THIS is beyond protected  speech. THIS is a direct threat on President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs life by militant #ANTIFA/ #BLM revolutionaries. https://t.co/pbHziws14l |
| 1027 | Just a basic perusal of the #BlackLivesMatter website will tell you all you need to know about their true agenda. Here's my response to them. #BLM #bcot #AACONS #BlackTwitter https://t.co/wQTsy8Owbl |
| 1027 | #BLM terrorists assault Catholic worshippers during Mass...  https://t.co/Q7m2T6Vwwe |
| 985 | Here‚Äôs how #BlackLivesMatter savages treated Catholics praying the Hail Mary. Threatening to beat women is the norm for #BLM men. https://t.co/1yWsyZt91P |
| 979 | This month, #BLEXIT raised $200k for black businesses which were destroyed in the #BLM riots. We also sent all of our minority state directors to local police departments to spread love &amp; form productive relationships.I‚Äôm so proud of the work our organization is doing. @BLEXIT https://t.co/a8pDqdcapD |
| 908 | HOLY SH*#: while interviewing this #BLM rioter in Kinosha he pulls out a real pistol and points it at my camera while explaining what we would do to cops if they rolled up on us right now It‚Äôs been a while since I had a gun pointed at me even if it was just to make a point https://t.co/hjQqO9Ccbb |
| 893 | Nothing says ‚Äòsocial justice‚Äô like #BlackLivesMatter activists hijacking an Amazon Prime delivery van. https://t.co/zXq8rgDGxA |
| 888 | K, so we all agree that #BLM was a covert fundraising campaign for @JoeBiden right? üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è |
