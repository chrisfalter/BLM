01.126% : Susan Rosenberg is VP of the fundraising arm of #BLM. She was charged for her role in the 1983 bombing of the United States Capitol Building and other targets. Convicted for explosives possession in 1985, she was sentenced to 58 years in prison. She was sprung by Bill Clinton. https://t.co/fHZgM5YUeN  
01.077% : I haven’t endured an anti-gay attack like this in probably 10 years. #BlackLivesMatter activists physically assault me &amp; Mike Harlow on our way into our hotel, calling us faggots &amp; threatening us. The one girl comes back &amp; knocks my friend’s phone out of her hand.
#BLM= violence https://t.co/Cmhc4g57tU  
01.045% : So a white guy shoots and kills a black cop - father of three - and there isn’t a word from #BlackLivesMatter, the @NBA, @NFL, @NHL, and @MLB. But if a cop kills a black career criminal or sex offender, they want to burn the city down. Think about that for a minute! https://t.co/ZHGdhnnBkk  
00.895% : This is a HUGE update on the #BlackLivesMatter donation scandal. It turns out I was right, and Politifact lied— Black Lives Matter is NOT a recognized charity. 
More information coming soon. 
Stay tuned. 
@BLEXIT and @JudicialWatch are looking into the #BLM scam financing.  
00.796% : His parents started a business in their garage forty years ago. Democrat-supported #BLM and  #Antifa terrorists burned it to the ground. For no reason.   https://t.co/L5YTlx0wVd  
00.761% : “How did #BlackLivesMatter become about LGBTQ when blacks really really aren’t about that?...we’re conservative. We don’t support abortion. We’re not about feminism... I’M NOT VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN”

#BLEXIT #Trump2020 https://t.co/3EXn3KI2bD  
00.684% : After a 1 year-old was shot &amp; killed, blacks in NYC are calling for a crime unit that was disbanded as a result of #blm protests, to be reinstated.

Shootings for the week are up 277% since last year.

Meanwhile, @BilldeBlasio is playing arts &amp; crafts in front of Trump Tower. https://t.co/AjnpwJK5z2  
00.679% : Rochester, N.Y.: #BLM rioters swarm a restaurant and knock over the dining tables. https://t.co/lxa0b5hHeh  
00.596% : The same people who chanted #BlackLivesMatter are now questioning a black woman’s medical credentials because she got her medical degree from Nigeria. 

Where did they get theirs?  
00.582% : Watch how “peaceful” #BLM protestors coordinate, surround and then attack me-simply because I am filming their police-escorted parade in the middle of Georgetown. 

I was physically assaulted and one of them snatched my phone. 

An owner of a nearby restaurant came fo my aid. https://t.co/W6wPooJvKU

02.093% : This woman DEFACED the #BlackLivesMatter mural at Contra Costa County courthouse on July 4th! We will repaint that mural and you will not silence our collective voice for justice!! #BLM https://t.co/2BgPC8nxHR  
01.936% : In the past 31 days, Donald Trump has called #BlackLivesMatter a symbol of hate.

He's sent unidentified federal agents to police Portland streets against peaceful protesters.

But he has NOT publicly called out Putin for reportedly offering bounties for American troops abroad.  
01.502% : #BlackLivesMatter It must be said because it isn’t implied

01.030% : To my white friends &amp; neighbors: “One recent poll of WI voters found that approval for #BlackLivesMatter protests dropped from 61% in June to 48% in August, &amp; all of the change came from whites.” We can't abide fair-weather, fickle friends. Our lives must matter more than this.  
00.772% : TRUMP’S AMERICA!
THIS JUST HAPPENED 1 HOUR AGO IN KENOSHA, WI.

COLD BLOODED MURDER!

00.693% : Armed couple wields AR-15 rifle or other weapon of war at #BLM demonstrators in Central West End section of St. Louis. Woman points handgun as they walk by the house en route to the Mayor.

This is an unprovoked display of lethal force. #StLouis #mccloskey https://t.co/2YZHwHuXfa  
00.690% : If #BLACKLivesMatter makes you angry because it doesn’t say #ALLLivesMatter, but #BLUELivesMatter doesn’t upset you, then what you’re really triggered about is the word ‘BLACK.’  
00.646% : Trump Tower is now bordered by a huge #BlackLivesMatter banner in the front and a giant #LGBTQpride rainbow 🌈 on one side. I think an enormous #MeToo mural would look great on the other side! https://t.co/Ydeu7e3Oer  
00.626% : This broke me. #BlackLivesMatter #MLB https://t.co/GT5XKYH7ju

16.261% : We’re so far from that bridge, Terry. #BlackLivesMatter is, in part, a rallying cry and a protest slogan to galvanize people into doing the justice work needed to derail the deaths, dehumanization and destruction of Black lives that racism causes.

Justice is not a competition.  
09.270% : I don’t feel compelled to choose between #BlackLivesMatter and caring about police lives. 

They don’t cancel each other out.

We can and should work together in Love to reimagine every system [especially if injustice is at the root] that stands against Love.  
05.728% : Many who erroneously quote my father today to oppose #BlackLivesMatter, diversity training and the #1619Project would have maligned him and supported Bull Connor and George Wallace in the 1960s. https://t.co/sJSqh2IBng
